# Jest-Another-RPG
Object Oriented Programming is a popular programming paradigm in which code is organized around objects instead of functions. This approach has the added advantage of helping us follow DRY practices
The object-oriented paradigm uses the concept of objects to hide the code, but more important, to make modeling the real world easier. A devveloper creates code objects  that mimic the real-world objects they emulate. These objects include properties, methods, and events to allow the object to behave in a particular manner.
Though no one really agres on its precise definition, object oriented programming has shaped the design of many programming languages. The core idea in object oriented programming is to divide programs into smaller pieces and make each piece responsible for managing it's own state. This way, some knowledge about the way a piece of the program works be kept local to that piece.

This program is a command-line role-playing game (RPG) in which the user battles a series of enemies whose health and stats can be sustained by taking a potion.
This game creates new objects using JavaScript constructor functions, and implements basic code tests using the Jest framework.
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity; it tests units of code to determine whether they're fit for use. Jest is very fast and opinionated, meaning that it makes assumptions about software development best practices and the architecture of the application youâ€™re testing. It also provides everything out of the box, without requiring a lot of configuration.
Using Test Driven Development helps us write code that's maintainable and follows best practices. It also gives us a little peace of mind as developers, knowing that the parts of our code that have tests are less likely to break unexpectedly. If our code does break at some point, it will be much easier to identify how to debug it because the failing tests will let us know exactly what went wrong.

## My approach towards building the game using the command line interface:

    -Build an entire application using object-oriented programming (OOP), separating data and functionality into different constructor functions.
    -Use modern ES6 class syntax to implement inheritance between classes.
    -Take user input and use template literals to dynamically generate an entire HTML page directly from the command line.
    -Integrate constructor functions into your applications, adding structure to your code and reducing the amount of code you have to write.
    -Build entire applications using OOP, separating data and functionality into distinct constructor functions that can be composed together.
    -Build applications using test-driven development, writing tests before implementing functionality.
    -Use modern ES6 class syntax to implement more advanced OOP patterns, like inheritance.
    -Create more scalable applications that follow the OOP paradigm.
    -Implement a basic test using the Jest framework.
    -Create new objects using constructor functions.
### Skills learned in this project: 
    Build an entire application using object-oriented programming (OOP), separating data and functionality into different constructor functions.

    Use modern ES6 class syntax to implement inheritance between classes.

    Verify that your code works as intended through automated tests using the Jest framework.

    Take user input and use template literals to dynamically generate an entire HTML page directly from the command line.

    
  The goal is to create an RPG with characters, enemies, and a game object. The user will have the choice to attack or use a potion to increase one of their three stats: strength, agility, and health. The simplest of all of the objects we'll need is a Potion object
TDD is a software development practice in which a developer creates failing test cases, and then writes code so that the tests pass. Once the tests pass, the developer refactors the code to keep it DRY. These three steps are commonly referred to as Red, Green, Refactor.

It's important to note that TDD isn't simply about adding tests. It encompasses the process of writing tests before you write a single line of code, and then writing code in small increments. This helps keep the code modular, and ensures that you don't write any more code than you need to.
